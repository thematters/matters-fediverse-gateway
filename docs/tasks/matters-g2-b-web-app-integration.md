# Task Handoff

## Context

G2-A proved that selected real public `matters.icu` article data can move through
`federation-export-dev`, the ActivityPub seed bundle, `gateway-core`, public
WebFinger / actor / outbox / NodeInfo probes, SQLite consistency scan, and
Misskey read-only verification.

G2-B is the product contract layer. It lets selected pilot authors understand
and control federation in Matters Web/App, while keeping production rollout
gated.

As of 2026-05-11, the code portion is merged to `develop`:

- `matters-server` PR #4773 added read-side federation settings, article
  eligibility, and pilot-scoped author/article mutations.
- `matters-web` PR #5883 added the account-level and per-article pilot UI
  controls.
- Both develop deploys passed on `matters.icu`.
- `server.matters.icu` exposes the expected G2-B schema fields and mutations.

The account permission gate is cleared and the pilot-owned article path has
passed staging validation:
`mashbean@matters.town` is confirmed as staging admin, has `fediverseBeta`, and
its account-level federation setting is enabled on `matters.icu`. The staging
article `23525` (`ckl5le599uwc`) is owned by the pilot account, the account
settings Fediverse row is visible and enabled, and the article edit settings
show the Fediverse override as `Follow author setting`.

## Recommended Product Contract

Use the conservative default:

- Author-level federation is default off.
- Only pilot authors can see and use the controls at first.
- Author setting must be explicitly `enabled` before any article can federate.
- Article setting defaults to `inherit`.
- Article `disabled` always blocks federation.
- Article `enabled` is only meaningful when the author setting is enabled.
- Paid, encrypted, private, archived, missing-identity, or otherwise non-public
  content cannot be federated regardless of settings.

This matches the existing server gate in
`matters-server/src/connectors/article/federationExportService.ts`.

## UI Entry Points

Author-level control:

- Repo: `matters-web`
- Suggested location: `src/views/Me/Settings/Misc/index.tsx`
- Add a `Fediverse` settings row near existing account/service settings.
- Row state should show `Off`, `On`, or `Pilot unavailable`.
- First implementation can be a dialog or drawer with one switch and
  explanatory copy.

Per-article control:

- Repo: `matters-web`
- Suggested location: `src/views/ArticleDetail/Edit/OptionContent/index.tsx`
- Add the control under the existing `Settings` tab.
- Query article setting from `src/views/ArticleDetail/Edit/gql.ts`.
- Disable the control for ineligible articles and show why.

Admin inspection:

- Repo: `matters-server` first, then `matters-web`
- Use existing admin-only mutations only for staging/internal setup until the
  user-facing mutation contract is added.
- Admin status should show pilot author setting, article overrides, latest export
  decision, failed delivery count, and rollback state.

## Copy Draft

Author setting title:

```text
Fediverse
```

Author setting description:

```text
讓其他 Fediverse 服務追蹤你的公開文章。付費、加密、私人與草稿內容不會送出。
```

Article setting title:

```text
同步到 Fediverse
```

Article setting states:

```text
跟隨帳號設定
允許這篇文章同步
不要同步這篇文章
```

Disabled-state copy:

```text
這篇文章目前不能同步。只有公開、已發布、作者身分正常的文章可以送到 Fediverse。
```

Beta warning:

```text
這是測試功能。同步後，公開文章與互動可能會出現在其他 Fediverse 服務。
```

## Backend Contract Gaps

Already present in `matters-server` after PR #4773:

- `putUserFederationSetting(input: { id, state })`
- `putArticleFederationSetting(input: { id, state })`
- `resolveFederationExportGate`
- `decisionReport`
- strict gate support for export runs
- Read-side GraphQL fields on viewer/user/article for current federation setting.
- Non-admin, pilot-scoped mutation for the viewer to update their own author
  setting.
- Author-owned mutation for article federation override.

Still needed after staging UI validation:

- Export trigger contract after publish/edit when an eligible public article
  changes.
- Audit log or durable decision record for setting changes and export decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pilot authors can see their author-level federation setting in Matters Web.
- Pilot authors can turn federation on or off for their own account.
- Pilot authors can set an article override to `inherit`, `enabled`, or
  `disabled` from article edit settings.
- Ineligible articles show a disabled state with a clear reason.
- The UI cannot override the server-side public-only boundary.
- Export trigger behavior is documented and covered by tests before production
  rollout.
- All user-facing copy is reviewed before beta.

## Verification Plan

Server:

- Targeted GraphQL tests for read fields and pilot-scoped mutations are covered
  in the merged server PR.
- Read-only `server.matters.icu` checks confirmed the schema fields and
  conservative default gate behavior.
- Strict-gate Lambda dry-run still blocks the paywalled article as
  `article_not_public`.

Web:

- API validation confirmed the pilot account has `fediverseBeta` and
  account-level federation is `enabled`.
- 2026-05-18 develop parity is deployed on `matters.icu`: `server.matters.icu`
  exposes `UserFeatures.fediverseBeta`, and the live
  `/me/settings/misc` page chunk queries `viewer.features.fediverseBeta`
  instead of admin-only `viewer.oss.featureFlags`.
- Manual browser QA on `matters.icu` confirmed the account settings row is
  visible/enabled and the pilot-owned public article shows the article-level
  Fediverse override as `Follow author setting`.
- Disabled-state copy is visible in the article settings panel: only public
  articles can be exported, while private or paywalled articles stay blocked by
  the server.

Gateway:

- No new runtime requirement for the first UI slice.
- Continue using staging public probes and SQLite consistency scan after export
  trigger dry-runs.
- 2026-05-12 deployed-Lambda strict-gate run
  `25712528545` selected public article `23520` and paywalled article `23522`;
  `23520` was exported, `23522` stayed blocked as `article_not_public`, the
  bundle was ingested by `gateway-core`, WebFinger / actor / outbox / NodeInfo
  probes passed, and SQLite consistency scan returned `totalDiffs=0`.
- 2026-05-12 deployed-Lambda strict-gate run
  `25713858021` selected pilot-owned public article `23525`
  (`ckl5le599uwc`); it was exported as
  `mashbeanmatters@staging-gateway.matters.town`, ingested by `gateway-core`,
  passed public WebFinger / actor / outbox / NodeInfo probes, resolved from
  gyutte.site Misskey via `users/show`, and kept SQLite consistency at
  `totalDiffs=0`.
- 2026-05-11 local gateway verification passed: `npm test` 117/117,
  `scan:consistency` total diffs `0`, `check:rollout-artifact` OK, and
  `check:secret-layout` OK.

## Human Gates

- Final copy approval.
- Whether pilot authors can force-enable individual public articles or only
  inherit/disable during the first beta.
- Legal/privacy approval before broader beta.
- Production storage and credential approval.
- Canonical identity cutover timing for `acct:user@matters.town`.
